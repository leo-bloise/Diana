# Diana

Diana is C# Library for building Discord bots. It is design to e easy to use and flexible, allowing developers to create bots with minimal effort.

## Features

- Native IHost support
	- It allows you to create a bot using the same patterns as ASP.NET Core applications.
	- It allows you to host a discord bot and other services in the same process.
- Dependency injection support
	- It allows you to use dependency injection to manage your bot's services and components.

I'm also creating a Discord bot using Diana, I want to create a bot that implements RPG-like features, such as character creation, inventory management, and combat.
The bot will also have a web interface for managing the bot and its features.
